[Thoughts of the COVID-19 outbreak phases changed from emergency response to combination of emergency response and regular prevention and control],"Yang, W. Z.","Given the scope and speed of virus spread, the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and dangerous. Complicated objective factors such as the long-term existence of source of infection, difficulty in completely blocking the transmission route and a large susceptible population determined that the COVID-19 pandemic might stay with us for long term. Therefore, we should be ready for a tough and long battle against the COVID-19 epidemic. The strategy should adhere to the principle of combining emergency response with regular prevention and control measures, and all efforts should be well harnessed in a coordinated way to keep the epidemic under control while securing the economic and social development.",2020,,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,41,0,E045-E045,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200404-00516,19258,#94588,Yang 2020,,,94588,22-04-20
[Clinical features and outcome of treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia: a meta-analysis],"Wu, Y. Y.; Li, H. Y.; Xu, X. B.; Zheng, K. X.; Qi, X. S.; Guo, X. Z.","Objective: To investigate the clinical features and outcome of treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia. Methods: Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases. The relevant data was extracted and a meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software V.2.8.0 to calculate the combined odds ratio. Results: Seven studies were included, consisting of 1594 cases. The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%). Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare. Aspartate aminotransferase (29%), alanine transaminase (22.7%), and total bilirubin (11.7%) levels were elevated, except for serum albumin levels (80.4%). The common therapeutic agents used were antibiotics (87.7%), antiviral drugs (75.5%), and glucocorticoids (26.6%), while antifungal agents (7.7%) were used in few. Mechanical ventilation (13.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.9%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.8%) were used in severe cases. The rate of mortality in hospital was 7.7%, respectively. Heterogeneity between studies was significant; however, subgroup and sensitivity analysis had failed to identify clear sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.",2020,,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,,,,32306657,10.3760/cma.j.cn501113-20200224-00067,20466,#94670,Wu 2020,,,94670,22-04-20

This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. Methods Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone. No team member developed COVID-19 infection. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urology consultations can be managed in a patient and physician safety-conscious manner, by implementing a novel triage pathway.",2020,,Urology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.059,19261,#94836,Borchert 2020,,,94836,22-04-20
Sonographic signs and patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia,"Volpicelli, Giovanni; Gargani, Luna","The pandemic of COVID-19 is seriously challenging the medical organization in many parts of the world. This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.",2020,,The Ultrasound Journal,12,1,22-22,,10.1186/s13089-020-00171-w,19497,#94853,Volpicelli 2020,,,94853,22-04-20

In challenge with this pandemic quarantine technique has been used widely after tens of years. In the course of the pandemic, many countries evacuated their citizens from affected regions and combined the evacuation with quarantine process. Some examples of these countries who evacuated their citizens are Germany, Italy, Spain, and USA. In further times, during the course of pandemic, according to spread, other countries evacuated their citizens from these countries too. Despite being the origin of the pandemic, in later times Wuhan was also a place where people were evacuated to.

The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020. Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected. The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006. The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic. Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels. This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).

A study conducted during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak detected SARS-CoV in tear samples in SARS patients in Singapore.[2] Lack of eye protection was a primary risk factor of SARS-CoV transmission from SARS patients to healthcare workers in Toronto, prompting a concern that respiratory illness could be transmitted through ocular secretions.[3][[4] Similar concerns have been raised with SARS-CoV-2, especially among eye care providers and those on the front lines triaging what could be initial symptoms of COVID-19. As conjunctivitis is a common eye condition, ophthalmologists may be the first medical professionals to evaluate a patient with COVID-19. Indeed, one of the first providers to voice concerns regarding the spread of Coronavirus in Chinese patients was Li Wenliang, MD, an ophthalmologist. He later died from COVID-19 and was believed to have contracted the virus from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient in his clinic.

Computed tomography (CT) has been described as a diagnostic modality in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan. We present a case series with virologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.

Antibody surveys suggesting vast undercount of coronavirus infections may be unreliable,"Vogel, Gretchen","Surveying large swaths of the public for antibodies to the new coronavirus promises to show how widespread undiagnosed infections are, how deadly the virus really is, and whether enough of the population has become immune for social distancing measures to be eased. But the first batch of results has generated more controversy than clarity. The survey results, from Germany, the Netherlands, and several locations in the United States, find that anywhere from 2% to 30% of certain populations have already been infected with the virus. The numbers imply that confirmed COVID-19 cases are an even smaller fraction of the true number of people infected than many had estimated and that the vast majority of infections are mild. But many scientists question the accuracy of the antibody tests and complain that several of the research groups announced their findings in the press rather than in preprints or published papers, where their data could be scrutinized.

On the one hand, antirheumatic drugs can increase the risk of infection and potentially deteriorate the course of an infection. On the other hand, an active inflammatory rheumatic disease can also increase the risk for an infection. In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology (www.dgrh.de), it is recommended that our patients continue the antirheumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity despite the pandemic. In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy. The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only asmall percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own. This result was independent of the individual anti-rheumatic therapy. Taken together, the results of this study illustrate not only the trustful patient-physician partnership in athreatening situation but also the high impact of state-of-the art recommendations by the respective scientific society.",2020,,Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,,,,,10.1007/s00393-020-00800-8,19440,#95158,Schmeiser 2020,,,95158,22-04-20
Public health literacy in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic emergency TT - Alfabetizacion en salud publica ante la emergencia de la pandemia por Covid-19,"Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia","Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance. This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life. This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency. This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility. Therefore, public health literacy is needed. La alfabetizacion en salud es el proceso centrado en la obtencion del conocimiento, la motivacion y las competencias individuales para entender y acceder a informacion, expresar opiniones y tomar decisiones relacionadas con la promocion y el mantenimiento de la salud, lo que es aplicable en diferentes contextos, entornos y a lo largo de toda la vida. Esta perspectiva conceptual es muy necesaria ante la emergencia del virus SARS-CoV-2 que produce la enfermedad Covid-19, la cual ha producido una pandemia con efectos devastadores, no solo desde el punto de vista de la salud, sino tambien, de manera muy importante, desde el economico, politico y social. En este ensayo se tratan de establecer los elementos basados en la evidencia cientifica que orientan las politicas publicas de prevencion y control, entre los que destacan: a) la inteligencia epidemiologica, la cual incluye no solo la estrategia de vigilancia poblacional sino, ante la imposibilidad real de identificacion de todos los casos positivos, la puesta en practica de estrategias de vigilancia centinela y la vigilancia basada en eventos; b) las medidas de mitigacion de la propagacion de la epidemia, tales como distanciamiento social e higiene, lavado de manos, cuarentena, restriccion de movimiento y utilizacion de cubrebocas, entre otras; c) medidas de supresion de la transmision cuando el numero de casos es muy elevado, como el endurecimiento de medidas drasticas de encierro en casa; d) fortalecimiento de la capacidad de atencion medica en los sistemas de salud e incremento de la capacidad de prevencion de la transmision en los servicios de salud, incluyendo la utilidad de las pruebas diagnosticas; y e) el desarrollo de vacunas profilacticas contra Covid-19, asi como la generacion de agentes terapeuticos. Todas estas acciones no solo deben implementarse rapidamente desde la perspectiva multidisciplinaria y multisectorial de la salud publica para contener, prevenir y controlar la epidemia, sino que necesitan obligatoriamente del concurso de la comunidad como responsabilidad compartida. Debido a todo esto, es necesaria la alfabetizacion en salud publica.",2020,,Salud publica de Mexico,,,,,10.21149/11408,19488,#95174,Lazcano-Ponce 2020,,,95174,22-04-20

"Melatonin: Roles in influenza, Covid-19, and other viral infections","Anderson, George; Reiter, Russel J.","There is a growing appreciation that the regulation of the melatonergic pathways, both pineal and systemic, may be an important aspect in how viruses drive the cellular changes that underpin their control of cellular function. We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial ""cytokine storm"", as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian ""resetting"" of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.",2020,,Reviews in medical virology,,,e2109-e2109,,10.1002/rmv.2109,19369,#95194,Anderson 2020,,,95194,22-04-20

The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health,"Liang, Leilei; Ren, Hui; Cao, Ruilin; Hu, Yueyang; Qin, Zeying; Li, Chuanen; Mei, Songli","The purposes of this study was to assess the youth mental health after the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) occurred in China two weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97–38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09–5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03–1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00–1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.",2020,,Psychiatric Quarterly,,,01-Dec,,10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3,19413,#95308,Liang 2020,,,95308,22-04-20

Emerging predictors for poor outcome include advanced age, male gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes and more recently obesity. Herein, we posit new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID-19 outcome, over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. We outline a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in subjects with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and cytokine amplification. We propose studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in subjects with obesity and COVID-19.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.

The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre—Wuhan, China. Materials and methods Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). Conclusions Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.",2020,,Respiratory Medicine,,,105980-105980,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980,19259,#95732,He 2020,,,95732,22-04-20
COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thromboembolic disease: Commentary on an interim expert guidance,"Cannegieter, Suzanne C.; Klok, Frederikus A.","Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative pathogen of a new infectious disease, COVID-19, that first occurred in late December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. It has since spread globally, resulting in a WHO declared pandemic, with as yet (17/4/20) more than two million confirmed cases and about 150.000 confirmed deaths. As for every new disease, clinicians, hospitals and governments struggle to find optimal clinical and public health measures to contain its spread and burden. For this, information from scientific research is crucial and fortunately we see a rapidly accumulating output of studies.",2020,,Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/rth2.12350,19464,#95740,Cannegieter 2020,,,95740,22-04-20
Medication management and adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives and experiences from low-and middle-income countries,"Kretchy, Irene A.; Asiedu-Danso, Michelle; Kretchy, James-Paul","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is placing a huge strain on health systems worldwide. Suggested solutions like social distancing and lockdowns in some areas to help contain the spread of the virus may affect special patient populations like those with chronic illnesses who are unable to access healthcare facilities for their routine care and medicines management. Retail pharmacy outlets are the likely facilities for easy access by these patients. The contribution of community pharmacists in these facilities to manage chronic conditions and promote medication adherence during this COVID-19 pandemic will be essential in easing the burden on already strained health systems. This paper highlights the pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases during this pandemic. This would provide support for the call by the WHO to maintain essential services during the pandemic, in order to prevent non-COVID disease burden on healthcare systems particularly in low-and middle-income countries.",2020,,Res Social Adm Pharm,,,,32307319,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.007,20424,#95746,Kretchy 2020,,,95746,22-04-20
Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2 and AXL in the human maternal-Fetal interface,"Zheng, Q. L.; Duan, T.; Jin, L. P.","2019 novel coronavirus disease has resulted in thousands of critically ill patients in China, which is a serious threat to people's life and health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported to share the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. Here, based on the public single-cell RNA-sequencing database, we analyzed the mRNA expression profile of putative receptor ACE2 and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) in the early maternal-fetal interface. The result indicates that the ACE2 has very low expression in the different cell types of early maternal-fetal interface, except slightly high in decidual perivascular cells cluster 1 (PV1). Interestingly, we found that the Zika virus (ZIKV) receptor AXL expression is concentrated in perivascular cells and stromal cells, indicating that there are relatively more AXL-expressing cells in the early maternal-fetal interface. This study provides a possible infection route and mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2- or ZIKV-infected mother-to-fetus transmission disease, which could be informative for future therapeutic strategy development.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 Among Children in China,"Dong, Yuanyuan; Mo, Xi; Hu, Yabin; Qi, Xin; Jiang, Fan; Jiang, Zhongyi; Tong, Shilu","OBJECTIVE: To identify the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of pediatric patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. METHODS: Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis. Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates. RESULTS: There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases. The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys. More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases. The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0-42 days). There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease. The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time. More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province. CONCLUSIONS: Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference. Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection. The distribution of children's COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas.

The researchers taking a gamble with antibody tests for coronavirus,"Maxmen, Amy","Despite uncertainties, some scientists are betting that blood tests will help end lockdowns and get people back to work. An employee from Beaumont Laboratory has her blood drawn. Last week, laboratories across the United States launched initiatives to test hundreds of thousands of people for antibodies against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. And they’re telling those people the results — despite uncertainty about what they mean. Researchers have been using antibody tests to try to reveal the true spread of the coronavirus in communities and cities. But these latest efforts are more controversial because they focus on an individual’s immune status. Unlike PCR-based tests, which identify genetic sequences belonging to the virus, these tests of the body’s immune response require more nuanced interpretation.",2020,,Nature,,,,,10.1038/d41586-020-01163-5,19677,#96350,Maxmen 2020,,,96350,22-04-20

SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus–host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown. Methods We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA. Findings SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0·52). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0·0098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0·036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0·016; FRhK4, p=0·0004). Interpretation As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

Participant and Caregiver Perspectives on Clinical Research During Covid-19 Pandemic,"Padala, Prasad R.; Jendro, Ashlyn M.; Gauss, C. Heath; Orr, Lillian C.; Dean, Kim T.; Wilson, Kerrie B.; Parkes, Christopher M.; Padala, Kalpana P.","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has massively disrupted essential clinical research. Many regulatory organizations have rightfully advocated to temporarily halt enrollment and curtail all face-to-face interactions. Views and opinions of patients and their caregivers are seldom considered while making such decisions. The objective was to study older participants' and their caregivers' perspectives to participate in ongoing clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional SETTING: VISN-16/Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Department of Veterans Affairs. PARTICIPANTS: Older participants and their caregivers (N=51) enrolled in ongoing clinical research studies. MEASUREMENTS: Questions about perceptions of safety to attend research visit, the level of panic among the general public, and medical center's preparedness in handling the pandemic. Other questions identified the source of pandemic information and the preference of a phone or in-person visit. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.3 (±9.4) years, 53% were male, 39% were caregivers, and 65% were Caucasian. Majority (78%) of the participants felt safe/very safe attending the scheduled research appointment; 63% felt that the extra screening made them feel safe/very safe; 82% felt that the medical center was prepared/very prepared for the pandemic. Participants split evenly on their preference for phone vs. in-person visits. Family members and television news media were the commonly used sources of pandemic information irrespective of their education. Perceptions were influenced by gender and source of information, not by age or education. Females perceived higher level of panic compared to males (p=0.02). Those relying on news media felt safer compared to those that relied on family members (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: Even though informants felt that the medical center was prepared to handle the pandemic, only half the participants preferred the in-person visit. Pandemic information was obtained from family members or the television news media. Knowing patients' perspectives may help researchers be better prepared for future pandemics.

METHODS: Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI,WanFang databases and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4 121 COVID-19 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95%CI: 65.9%-81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%,95%CI: 54.8%-78.7 %) and just a little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density was ground-glass opacities (68.1%,95%CI: 56.9%-78.2%). Other changes in density included air bronchogram sign(44.7%), crazy-paving pattern (35.6%) and consolidation (32.0%). Patchy (40.3%), spider web sign (39.5%), cord-like (36.8%) and nodular (20.5%) were common lesion shapes in COVID-19 patients. Pleural thickening (27.1%) was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy(5.4%) and pleural effusion (5.3%) were rare. CONCLUSION: The lung lesions of patients with COVID-19 were mostly bilateral lungs or multilobar involved. The most common chest CT findings were patchy and ground-glass opacities. Some patients had air bronchogram, spider web sign and cord-like. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare.

Psychological stress of medical staffs during outbreak of COVID-19 and adjustment strategy,"Wu, Wenzhi; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Pu; Zhang, Li; Wang, Guixiang; Lei, Guanghui; Xiao, Qiang; Cao, Xiaochen; Bian, Yueran; Xie, Simiao; Huang, Fei; Luo, Na; Zhang, Jingyuan; Luo, Mingyan","COVID-19 has a significant impact on public health and poses a challenge to medical staffs, especially to front-line medical staffs who are exposed to direct contact with patients. To understand the psychological stress status of medical staffs during the outbreak of COVID-19. Random sample questionnaire survey was conducted among 2110 medical staffs and 2158 college students in all provinces of china through a questionnaire which was compiled and completed through the Questionnaire Star platform relying on Wechat, QQ and other social software. The differences in psychological stress status of different groups were compared through the analysis of the questionnaire. Results revealed that in all provinces of china, medical staffs scored significantly higher on all items of psychological stress than college students(P<0.001). In Wuhan, medical staff scored significantly higher than college students in all items of psychological stress(P<0.001). While for medical staff, the group in Wuhan area scored significantly higher than the group outside Wuhan on ""Thought of being in danger"", ""The possibility of self-illness"", ""Worrying about family infection""(P<0.05), ""Poor sleep quality"", ""Needing psychological guidance"" and ""Worrying about being infected""(P<0.01) items in the psychological stress questionnaire, and in the item of ""Confidence in the victory of the epidemic"", the group in Wuhan area scored significantly lower than the group in the area outside Wuhan(P<0.05). The emotion, cognition, physical and mental response of front-line medical staff showed obvious ""exposure effect"", and psychological crisis intervention strategy can be helpful.

Letter to the Editor: Acute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID-19 receiving tocilizumab,"Morrison, Austin R.; Johnson, Joseph M.; Ramesh, Mayur; Bradley, Patrick; Jennings, Jeffery; Smith, Zachary R.","Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody and is progressing as a viable and promising treatment option in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IL-6 is known to have both immunomodulatory and metabolic actions. In this letter we outline two cases of acute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab: one with elevated biomarkers consistent with acute pancreatitis the other without. Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID-19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes. The observations from our two cases highlight the complex, not fully elucidated interrelationship between elevated IL-6 and pharmacologic interventions impacting this pathway. Clinicians should consider monitoring for hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis as described with chronic tocilizumab use for rheumatoid arthritis in those receiving it for COVID-19.

"Epidemiological trends of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy during March 2020. From 1,000 to 100,000 cases","La Maestra, Sebastiano; Abbondandolo, Angelo; De Flora, Silvio","The COVID-19 epidemic started in Italy by the end of January 2020 and, after one month, it affected 1,049 persons. Based on the Italian Ministry of Health data, we reconstructed the daily course of virus-positive cases and deaths during March 2020 for whole Italy, 19 regions and 2 provinces. From February 29 to March 31 there was a 100.9-fold increase in the cumulative number of cases and a 428.6-fold increase in the number of deaths in Italy. When plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, the curves tended to diverge from linearity with 23%, 16%, and 7% average daily increases during the 3 decades of March. Similarly, the number of deaths decreased from an average daily growth of 19% during the 2nd decade to 10% during the 3rd decade. The correlation coefficients relating the days to cases or deaths during each one of the 3 decades approached the unity. As inferred from the equations of the regression lines relative to the 3 decades, the doubling times of cases were 3.4, 5.1 and 9.6 days, respectively. The doubling times of deaths during the 2nd and 3rd decades were 4.9 and 7.0 days, respectively. There was a broad geographic variability, with a striking gradient from North, where 40.8% of cases and 57.9% of deaths occurred in Lombardy, to South. On the whole, during March there was a trend to epidemic growth decline, but the time for the end of the epidemic will depend on a variety of factors and, at present, it is unpredictable.

Understanding evolution of SARS-CoV-2: a perspective from analysis of genetic diversity of RdRp gene,"Kasibhatla, Sunitha M.; Kinikar, Meenal; Limaye, Sanket; Kale, Mohan M.; Kulkarni-Kale, Urmila","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 emerged as the first example of ""Disease X"", a hypothetical disease of humans caused by an unknown infectious agent that was named as novel coronavirus and subsequently designated as SARS-CoV-2. The origin of the outbreak at the animal market in Wuhan, China implies it as a case of zoonotic spillover. The study was designed to understand evolution of Betacoronaviruses and in particular diversification of SARS-CoV-2 using RdRp gene, a stable genetic marker. METHODS: Phylogenetic and population stratification analyses were carried out using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, respectively. RESULTS: Molecular phylogeny using RdRp, showed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates cluster together. Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoVs are observed to branch off prior to SARS-CoV-2 cluster. While SARS-CoV form a single cluster, Bat-CoVs form multiple clusters. Population-based analyses revealed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV form separate clusters with no admixture. Bat-CoVs were found to have single and mixed ancestry and clustered as four sub-populations. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based analyses of Betacoronaviruses using RdRp, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is a homogeneous population. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have evolved from Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13, which diversified from a common ancestor from which Pangolin-CoVs have also evolved. The admixed Bat-CoV sub-populations indicate that bats serve as reservoirs harboring virus ensembles that are responsible for zoonotic spillovers such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The extent of admixed isolates of Bat-CoVs observed in population diversification studies underline the need for periodic surveillance of bats and other animal reservoirs for potential spillovers as a measure towards preparedness for emergence of zoonosis.

Chinese Public Attention to COVID-19 Epidemic: Based on Social Media,"Zhao, Yuxin; Cheng, Sixiang; Yu, Xiaoyan; Xu, Huilan","BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Top Concerns of Tweeters During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study,"Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair","BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.",2020,,J Med Internet Res,,,,32287039,10.2196/19016,21735,#96777,Abd-Alrazaq 2020,,,96777,22-04-20
The Technique and Justification for Minimally Invasive Surgery in COVID-19 Pandemic: Laparoscopic Anterior Resection for Near Obstructed Rectal Carcinoma,"Pawar, Tushar; Pokharkar, Ashish; Gori, Jayesh; Pandey, Diwakar; Rohila, Jitender; Dsouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish","Introduction: The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has made surgeons change and take on newer strategies and safe exercises. All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.",2020,,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Baby pangolins on my plate: possible lessons to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic,"Volpato, Gabriele; Fontefrancesco, Michele F.; Gruppuso, Paolo; Zocchi, Dauro M.; Pieroni, Andrea","The Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine (JEET), throughout its 15 years of existence, has tried to provide a respected outlet for scientific knowledge concerning the inextricable links between human societies and nature, food, and health. Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena.

Sonography of the Lungs: Diagnosis and Surveillance of Patients With COVID-19,"Evans, Kevin D.; Yang, Qian; Liu, Yang; Ye, Ruizhong; Peng, Chengzhong","The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) with symptoms that mimic bronchitis and other chest infections has created a need for quick diagnosis to prevent disease spread. Traditionally, computed tomography (CT) has been used as the primary method to identify infection and staging of the virus. While effective, repeated use of ionizing radiation, particularly in susceptible patient populations, can add risk as the disease is monitored through full recovery. Sonography of the chest may be a viable alternative for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. In addition, new technology such as the remote robotic ultrasound equipment being used at Zhejiang Provincial People?s Hospital in Hangzhou, China, has the potential to facilitate sonographic evaluation with minimal disease exposure to the sonologist and to other patients by eliminating the need for patient transport to imaging facilities. Additional studies will need to be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of sonography versus other imaging modalities in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other novel diseases.",2020,,Journal of Diagnostic Medical Sonography,,,8756479320917107-8756479320917107,,10.1177/8756479320917107,19320,#97431,Evans 2020,,,97431,22-04-20
"Knowledge, Perceptions, and Attitude of Egyptians Towards the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir; Mohammed, Zeinab; Ibrahim, Maha Emad; Ziady, Hany H.; Alorabi, Mohamed; Ayyad, Mohamed; Sultan, Eman A.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata.

Cytology in the time of coronavirus disease (covid-19): an Italian perspective,"Vigliar, Elena; Iaccarino, Antonino; Bruzzese, Dario; Malapelle, Umberto; Bellevicine, Claudio; Troncone, Giancarlo","INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is changing the way we practice pathology, including fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnostics. Although recommendations have been issued to prioritise patients at high oncological risk, postponing those with unsuspicious presentations, real world data have not been reported yet. METHODS: The percentages of the cytological sample types processed at the University of Naples Federico II, during the first 3 weeks of Italian national lockdown were compared with those of the same period in 2019. RESULTS: During the emergency, the percentage of cytology samples reported as malignant increased (p<0.001), reflecting higher percentages of breast (p=0.002) and lymph nodes FNAs (p=0.008), effusions (p<0.001) and urine (p=0.005). Conversely, thyroid FNAs (p<0.001) and Pap smears (p=0.003) were reduced.

A big data analysis on the five dimensions of emergency management information in the early stage of COVID-19 in China,"Huang, Hao; Peng, Zongchao; Wu, Hongtao; Xie, Qihui","The all-round and multilevel responses to the epidemic, with professional medical institutions, the governments and the public as the main agents of response and the media as the bridge of communication, are key to developing the public health emergency management system with regard to emerging infectious diseases and diseases with unknown etiology in the information age. This study creates an analysis framework concerning the five dimensions of information—the epidemic itself and the medical, governmental, public and media responses—and analyzes the evolution, interaction and trends of five dimensions using big data within the period of observation For the four dimensions other than the media response, the level of information related to the epidemic and the medical response is relatively high, while the level of response by medical institutions and the governments are similar, and both are higher than the public response. The media coverage of the epidemic remains at a high level of information. In relation to such diseases, the government should take the role of big data analytics seriously, lead a multi-agent social collaboration network, and further strengthen the ‘One Planning Plus Three Systems’ framework related to emergency management in China.",2020,,Journal of Chinese Governance,,,Jan-21,,10.1080/23812346.2020.1744923,19296,#97463,Huang 2020,,,97463,22-04-20
Fast Identification of Possible Drug Treatment of Coronavirus Disease -19 (COVID-19) Through Computational Drug Repurposing Study,"Wang, Junmei","The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market. It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-Cov-2. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-Cov-2 main protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,1 I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (Molecular Mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area-Weighted Solvent-Accessible Surface Area).2-4 Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 main protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-Cov, SARS-Cov-2, MERS-Cov, and HCV. The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-Cov-2 main protease.",2020,,Journal of chemical information and modeling,,,,,10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00179,19587,#97464,Wang 2020,,,97464,22-04-20

"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in diverse samples: Protocol to validate the sufficiency of provider-observed home-collected blood, saliva and oropharyngeal samples","Sullivan, Patrick Sean; Sailey, Charles; Guest, Jodie Lynn; Guarner, Jeannette; Siegler, Aaron Julius; Valentine-Graves, Mariah; Gravens, Laura; Del Rio, Carlos; Sanchez, Travis Howard","UNSTRUCTURED: Background: The US response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for infection. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. Objective: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. Methods: In this protocol, patient collection of samples will be done with observation by a provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a healthcare provider through a HIPPA-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the sufficiency of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the laboratory evidence of sufficient biological material in the mailed-in specimens. Conclusions: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing.

Data Mining and Content Analysis of the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak: Retrospective Observational Infoveillance Study,"Li, Jiawei; Xu, Qing; Cuomo, Raphael; Purushothaman, Vidya; Mackey, Tim","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is rapidly spreading worldwide with over 1.9 million cases as of mid-April 2020. Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.",2020,,JMIR Public Health Surveill,,,,32293582,10.2196/18700,21399,#97491,Li 2020,,,97491,22-04-20
The Role of YouTube and the Entertainment Industry in Saving Lives by Educating and Mobilizing the Public to Adopt Behaviors for Community Mitigation of COVID-19: Successive Sampling Design Study,"Basch, Charles E.; Basch, Corey H.; Hillyer, Grace C.; Jaime, Christie","BACKGROUND: Effective community mitigation through voluntary behavior change is currently the best way to reduce mortality caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March samples were viewed >125 million times and >355 million times, respectively. Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample.

"COVID-19 mobile positioning surveillance and contact tracing, and patient privacy","Ekong, Iniobong; Chukwu, Emeka; Chukwu, Martha","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease pandemic is the biggest global economic and health challenge of the century. Its effect and impact are still evolving with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if not checked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace primary and secondary contacts using technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing globally. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology in handling the COVID 19 pandemic spread. We made recommendations for how Nigeria can adopt this approach in context of Nigeria's Data protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potentials, digital contact tracing always comes in conflict with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage telecommunications call detail registry (CDR) to complement current strategies within the NDPR regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study show that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulation.

Maternal health care management during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019,"Chen, Yu; Li, Zhe; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Zhao, Wei-Hua; Yu, Zhi-Ying","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contagious pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the strong efforts taken to control the epidemic, hundreds of thousands of people were infected worldwide by 11 March, and the situation was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infection due to immune and anatomic alteration, though hospital visits may increase the chance of infection, the lack of medical care during pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, a well-managed system that allows pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is desired during the outbreak. Here, we present the managing processes of three pregnant women who had fever during hospitalization in the gynecology or obstetrics department, and then, we further summarize and demonstrate our maternal health care management strategies including antenatal care planning, patient triage based on the risk level, admission control, and measures counteracting emergencies and newly discovered high-risk cases at in-patient department. In the meantime, we will explain the alterations we have done throughout different stages of the epidemic and also review relative articles in both Chinese and English to compare our strategies with those of other areas.

The impact of video-mediated communication on closed wound assessments in post-operative consultations: a conversation analytical study of video-mediated and co-present consultations,"Stommel, Wyke; van Goor, Harry; Stommel, Martijn","BACKGROUND: Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultation is increasing rapidly and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that focused on physical examination in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in post-surgery consultations has never been studied yet. Also, comparative analysis of the face-to-face and video-setting on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the impact of video technology on the workings of assessments of post-surgery wounds and its limits. METHODS: We recorded 22 post-operative video consultations and 17 post-operative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was informing the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen and the secondary purpose was checking on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of Conversation Analysis. RESULTS: The way in which an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (15 out of 17) involve wound showings in the context of which surgeons report their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assess what these observations imply or what can be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (3 out of 22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments in which diagnostic criteria like redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""I think"", ""sounds... good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in case of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may reside in questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the video technology on post-operative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians inquire and patients provide their own, ""lay"" observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that in video consultations patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in case of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target-constituent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CL(pro) inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine, Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating. This results in general therapeutic effects for early COVID-19 control and prevention.",2020,,J Integr Med,,,,32307268,10.1016/j.joim.2020.03.004,20428,#97719,Zhang 2020,,,97719,22-04-20

Clinical characteristics and diagnostic challenges of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Chang, Tu-Hsuan; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Chang, Luan-Yin","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare. The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild.

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.

Severe cerebral involvement in adult-onset hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"Radmanesh, Farid; Rodriguez-Pla, Alicia; Pincus, Michael D.; Burns, Joseph D.","The diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with cerebral involvement is challenging given the rarity of HLH and its resemblance to the much more common severe sepsis. Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare. HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction. Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 x 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 x 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-gamma by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).",2020,,J Clin Invest,,,,32217835,10.1172/JCI137244,24276,#98087,Chen 2020,,,98087,22-04-20

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.

Respiratory viral panels and pediatric airway evaluation: the role of testing for upper respiratory infections to stratify perioperative risk,"Niermeyer, Weston L.; Ball, Jessica; Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda; Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy","Objectives Children admitted with stridor and respiratory distress comprise a complex patient group that requires the otolaryngologist to decide when to assess and intervene with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB). Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. Conclusions Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.",2020,,International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology,,,110057-110057,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057,19376,#98350,Niermeyer 2020,,,98350,22-04-20

Family violence and COVID-19: Increased vulnerability and reduced options for support,"Usher, Kim; Bhullar, Navjot; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Jackson, Debra","Family violence refers to threatening or other violent behaviour within families that may be physical, sexual, psychological, or economic, and can include child abuse and intimate partner violence (Peterman et al. 2020, van Gelder et al. 2020). Family violence during pandemics is associated with a range of factors including economic stress, disaster-related instability, increased exposure to exploitative relationships, and reduced options for support (Peterman et al. 2020). Due to the social isolation measures implemented across the globe to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, people living in volatile situations of family violence are restricted to their homes. Social isolation exacerbates personal and collective vulnerabilities while limiting accessible and familiar support options (van Gelder et al. 2020). In many countries, including Australia, we have already seen an increase in demand for domestic violence services and reports of increased risk for children not attending schools (Duncan, 2020); a pattern similar to previous episodes of social isolation associated with epidemics and pandemics (Boddy, Young & O'Leary 2020).",2020,,International journal of mental health nursing,,,,,10.1111/inm.12735,19249,#98360,Usher 2020,,,98360,22-04-20

For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision. This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry. The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated. Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website. One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital. Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely. Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%).

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be auseful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, aselective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms ""telemedicine"" and ""COVID-19."" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to areliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than atraditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make adecisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.",2020,,Hno,,,,,10.1007/s00106-020-00864-7,19426,#98728,Hagge 2020,,,98728,22-04-20

W. X.; Tan, Y. L.; Tan, B. Y. Q.; Teoh, H. L.; Ong, S. T.; Allen, D. M.; Sharma, V. K.","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease of pandemic proportions. Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients. Objectives: We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance. The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19. All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, P <.0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, P <.0001]. Out of 158 respondents, 128 (81.0%) respondents developed de novo PPE-associated headaches. A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; P =.030) and combined PPE usage for >4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; P =.012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches. Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance. Conclusion: Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.",2020,,Headache,,,,,10.1111/head.13811,20028,#98794,Ong 2020,,,98794,22-04-20

There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. RESULTS: Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs.

The Lombardy region faced firstly this outbreak in Italy and recorded rapidly a saturation of intensive care and internal medicine beds. Consequently, this lack of technical and human resources, together with people mobility restriction to contain virus spreading, determined the interruption of elective surgical and interventional cardiovascular procedures. In addition, the emergency track of acute patients has been rewritten due to limited resources and viral co-infection (pre- or in-hospital). Herein, we describe two cases of acute coronary syndrome with severe coronary artery disease and an indication for coronary artery bypass grafting. The first patient, COVID-19 positive, was treated with transcatheter technique due to symptom instability and underwent temporary circulatory support without intubation. The second patient received an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then transferred, in accordance with government emergency provisions, to a hub hospital to undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and short intensive care unit stay.

"[ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus]","Verdecchia, Paolo; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Angeli, Fabio","Some Authors recently suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should be discontinued, even temporarily, given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",2020,,G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,,,32310915,10.1714/3343.33127,20324,#98848,Verdecchia 2020,,,98848,22-04-20

[Being a cardiologist at the time of SARS-COVID-19: is it time to reconsider our way of working?],"Tarantini, Luigi; Navazio, Alessandro; Cioffi, Giovanni; Turiano, Giovanni; Colivicchi, Furio; Gabrielli, Domenico","The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease. The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.",2020,,G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,,,32310921,10.1714/3343.33133,20318,#98852,Tarantini 2020,,,98852,22-04-20

Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration. In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels. In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.",2020,,G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,,,32310916,10.1714/3343.33128,20323,#98864,Alderighi 2020,,,98864,22-04-20
"Advances in COVID-19: the virus, the pathogenesis, and evidence-based control and therapeutic strategies","Zhou, Guangbiao; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early December 2019, 81 174 confirmed cases and 3242 deaths have been reported in China as of March 19, 2020. The Chinese people and government have contributed huge efforts to combat this disease, resulting in significant improvement of the situation, with 58 new cases (34 were imported cases) and 11 new deaths reported on March 19, 2020. However, as of March 19, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop in 167 countries/territories outside of China, and 128 665 confirmed cases and 5536 deaths have been reported, with 16 498 new cases and 817 new deaths occurring in last 24 hours. Therefore, the world should work together to fight against this pandemic. Here, we review the recent advances in COVID-19, including the insights in the virus, the responses of the host cells, the cytokine release syndrome, and the therapeutic approaches to inhibit the virus and alleviate the cytokine storm.

Socially distanced school-based nutrition program feeding under COVID 19 in the rural Niger Delta,"Francis, Nabie Nubari; Pegg, Scott","The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is widely recognized as a complex and contentious space for oil exploration and production. Over the past few decades, the Niger Delta has witnessed large-scale mass peaceful mobilizations and rebellion-like conditions from violent militia groups. Oil companies have been implicated in violence perpetrated by Nigerian security forces. Local host communities have suffered greatly from corruption, political instability, violence and the environmental devastation of their farmlands and fishing grounds. Oil companies have increasingly turned to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to attempt to build or repair relations with oil-producing communities. There are also governmental and non-governmental humanitarian actors supporting various initiatives in the oil-producing areas. This article highlights the challenges that one long running micro-scale development project has faced due to the COVID 19 disease outbreak and the closure of all schools in Rivers State, Nigeria in March 2020.

SARS-Cov-2 infection: Response of human immune system and possible implications for the rapid test and treatment,"di Mauro, Gabriella; Cristina, Scavone; Concetta, Rafaniello; Francesco, Rossi; Annalisa, Capuano","The new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of beta-coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004. Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment.

Challenges in the Care of IBD Patients During the CoViD-19 Pandemic: Report From a “Red Zone” Area in Northern Italy,"Occhipinti, Vincenzo; Pastorelli, Luca","In December 2019, the first, troublesome news concerning a novel and highly infective viral pneumonia spreading from Wuhan (China) came to our attention.1 It was difficult at that time to predict, let alone imagine, the magnitude of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would change the way we practice medicine (not to mention our lives) only 2 months later. The first report on February 20 of a severe case of coronavirus disease 19 (CoViD-19) in a fit, young male from Codogno, a town just south of Milan, was rapidly followed by the identification of clusters of infected patients in the densely populated Lombardia region (approximately 10 million inhabitants with a density of 421.6 inhabitants/sq km) and in nearby regions within Northern Italy.2 Our hospital, Policlinico San Donato Research Hospital, is a university hospital located in the southeastern part of the Milan metropolitan area, where it represents one of the largest clinics in the territory. Our daily activity as gastroenterologists was immediately affected. We promptly implemented a strategy of phone call screenings before any gastrointestinal (GI) consults or endoscopic procedures, questioning patients about their geographic provenance (prohibiting patients from coming from the so-called red zone, the area surrounding Codogno), suspicious symptoms, and high-risk contacts. We had just started to contemplate how to safely continue our endoscopic activities in the absence of clear indications regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when within a few days the regional health system was overwhelmed by a massive number of CoViD-19 patients. Lombardia rapidly became one of the most severely affected regions of the world, with 54,802 infected individuals, identified by performing 176,953 nasopharyngeal swabs, and 10,022 deaths by April 9.3 On March 8, the entire region was declared a red zone, and 2 days later a complete national lockdown was declared. Within the entire national territory, all nonurgent consults and procedures were cancelled and indefinitely postponed. With routine activities halted, all gastroenterologists from our GI unit except one have been reassigned to provide care to CoViD-19 patients. One after another, seven CoViD-19 units were created and staffed with doctors of various specialties to manage >200 dedicated hospital beds. A small internal medicine ward, dedicated to care for the few noninfected patients accessing the hospital for urgent medical conditions, was preserved and also used for GI emergencies. In 2 weeks our hospital, like many others in Northern Italy, was almost completely converted into a CoViD-19 hospital. Every possible effort was made to quickly increase the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) to accommodate the alarming numbers of very sick CoViD-19 patients, including constructing new units in unused areas of the hospital or converting surgical rooms into ICUs. These drastic measures were implemented in a very short period of time, and although necessary to counteract the devastation brought about by the outbreak, they also posed tremendous challenges to the care of patients with GI conditions, including those with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Indeed, with severely reduced resources in regard to personnel, equipment, and space to manage patients, our IBD center had to face several critical issues.",,,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,,,,,10.1093/IBD/IZAA084,19421,#99070,,,,99070,22-04-20

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many countries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavirus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at understanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV.",2020,,Infez Med,,,,32275259,,22380,#99075,Rabaan 2020,,,99075,22-04-20

Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it. Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations. Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community—social, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself.

In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named novel coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.

Abdominal Pain: A Real Challenge in Novel COVID-19 Infection,"Poggiali, Erika; Ramos, Pau Mateo; Bastoni, Davide; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea","COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Since its detection in China at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms. Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome.

"[COVID-19, THE KIDNEY AND HYPERTENSION]","Angel-Korman, Avital; Brosh, Tal; Glick, Karina; Leiba, Adi","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats. The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.",2020,,Harefuah,,,,32307955,,20396,#99331,Angel-Korman 2020,,,99331,22-04-20

Considering the rapid spread of the infection, all patients in France must be considered as potentially infected by the virus. Nevertheless, patients without clinical or radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected. Instructions for personal protection include specific wound dressings and decontamination of all material used. The operating room should be ventilated after each tracheostomy and the pressure of the room should be neutral or negative. Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room. Ventilation must be optimized during the procedure, to limit patient oxygen desaturation. Drug assisted neuromuscular blockage is advised to reduce coughing during tracheostomy tube insertion.

The Korean government has declared the highest infectious-disease alert as a 'red' and the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the highest level (Phase 6). Control of COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide public health problem that governments and individuals must overcome. Recently, infection cluster occurred in a call center located in Seoul. The Ministry of Employment and Labor has decided to support call center companies use the cost of installing partitions, air purifiers, hand sanitizers and masks to prevent droplet and aerosol infections. Air purifiers are expected to be installed on the floor and exhaust stayed on the higher level such as desk or breathing zone of worker. When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague's respiratory system, the droplets can spread throughout the call center space through the air flow. If there is only one infected person, there is a chance that the infection cluster will increase. Installation of air purifiers may cause new problems, so the control to prevent infection should not lead to a new infection.

Leaders that employ a well-considered framework with an incremental approach will be able to gradually restart society while simultaneously maintaining public health benefits achieved through lockdown measures. Economically vulnerable populations cannot endure long-term lockdown and most countries lack the ability to maintain a full nationwide relief operation. Decision-makers need to understand this risk and how the Maslow hierarchy of needs and the social determinants of health can guide whole of society policies. Aligning decisions with societal needs will help ensure all segments of society are catered for and met while managing the crisis.

Social media posts provide a record of the public's attention to an outbreak. To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related key words in their posts. METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019-February 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online.

Trust in Humanitarian Aid From the Earthquake in 2017 to COVID-19 in Iran: A Policy Analysis,"Seddighi, Hamed","The earthquake of November 2017, the great flood of April 2019, and the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 are 3 major emergencies in Iran during the last 3 years. A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.",2020,,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,,,32216858,10.1017/dmp.2020.54,24314,#99540,Seddighi 2020,,,99540,22-04-20

Patients with ketosis were younger (median age: 47.0 vs 58.0 years, P = 0.003) and had greater prevalence of fatigue (31.0% vs 10.6%, P < 0.001), diabetes (35.7% vs 18.5%, P = 0.007), and digestive disorders (31.0% vs 12.0%, P < 0.001). However, they had longer length of hospital stay (19.0 [12.8-33.3] days vs 16.0 [10.0-24.0] days, P < 0.001) and higher mortality rate (21.4% vs 8.9%, P = 0.017).

Linear Regression Analysis to predict the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 6 weeks from day 0 (100 cases - March 14th 2020),"Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak","INTRODUCTION: and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. RESULTS: A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31-2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic,"Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.",2020,,Diabetes Metab Syndr,,,,32311651,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019,20260,#99645,Cure 2020,,,99645,22-04-20
Barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases: a rapid qualitative evidence synthesis,"Houghton, Catherine; Meskell, Pauline; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Glenton, Claire; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S.; Devane, Declan; Biesty, Linda M.","BACKGROUND: This review is one of a series of rapid reviews that Cochrane contributors have prepared to inform the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers' adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time-consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. SEARCH METHODS: We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with a distinct qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by our search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture a range of respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data-rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a 'best fit framework approach' to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS: We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. Our review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers' ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of s pport they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw the value of it. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.",2020,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,,CD013582-CD013582,,10.1002/14651858.CD013582,19601,#99717,Houghton 2020,,,99717,22-04-20

Responding to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore: Staff Protection and Staff Temperature and Sickness Surveillance Systems,"Htun, Htet Lin; Lim, Dwee Wee; Kyaw, Win Mar; Loh, Wan-Ning Janis; Lee, Lay Tin; Ang, Brenda; Chow, Angela","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore has routinely fit-tested staff for high filtration N95 respirators, and established web-based staff surveillance systems. The routine systems were enhanced in response to Singapore’s first imported COVID-19 case on January 23,2020. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, from January 23,2020 to February 23,2020, among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital co-located with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of February 23,2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multi-pronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures:(1) Risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) Staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) Enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff. Results A total of 10,583 staff were placed on hospital-wide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1,524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of eight staff illness episodes was seen per day, and almost 10% (n=29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19. Conclusions A robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.",2020,,Clinical Infectious Diseases,,,,,10.1093/cid/ciaa468,19485,#99752,Htun 2020,,,99752,22-04-20

Adapting to a pandemic - conducting oncology trials during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Tan, Aaron C.; Ashley, David M.; Khasraw, Mustafa","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has necessitated changes in cancer care delivery as resources are reallocated. Clinical trials and other research activities are inevitably impacted. Start-up activities for new trials may be deferred and recruitment suspended. For patients already enrolled however, there are challenges in continuing treatment on trial. Regulatory bodies have issued guidance on managing clinical trials during the pandemic, including contingency measures for remote study visits, delivery of investigational product and site monitoring visits. New cancer clinical trial practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic include new risk assessment strategies, decentralized and remote trial co-ordination, data collection and delegation of specific therapeutic activities. This experience could provide evidence of more feasible and cost-effective methods for future clinical trial conduct.",2020,,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,,,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-1364,19356,#99761,Tan 2020,,,99761,22-04-20
Clinical and Autoimmune Characteristics of Severe and Critical Cases with COVID-19,"Zhou, Yaqing; Han, Tao; Chen, Jiaxin; Hou, Can; Hua, Lei; He, Shu; Guo, Yi; Zhang, Sheng; Wang, Yanjun; Yuan, Jinxia; Zhao, Chenhui; Zhang, Jing; Jia, Qiaowei; Zuo, Xiangrong; Li, Jinhai; Wang, Liansheng; Cao, Quan; Jia, Enzhi","Abstract We aimed to report the clinical and autoimmune characteristics of severe and critical novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. The clinical, autoimmune, and laboratory characteristics of 21 patients who had laboratory-confirmed severe and critical cases of COVID-19 from the intensive care unit (ICU) ward of the Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China were investigated. A total of 21 patients (13 males and eight females) including eight (38.1%) severe cases and 13 (61.9%) critical cases were enrolled. Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most of them (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission. The most common characteristics on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%). The most common findings on laboratory measurements were lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (94.7%), and Interleukin-6 (89.5%). The prevalence of anti-52 kDa SSA/Ro antibody, anti-60 kDa SSA/Ro antibody and antinuclear antibody in the cases was 20%, 25% and 50% respectively. In the present work, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data from 21 severe and critical cases with COVID-19. Autoimmune phenomena exist in COVID-19 subjects, and the results provide the rationale for a strategy of prevention of dysfunction of immune and optimal immunosuppressive therapy in the future.",2020,,Clinical and Translational Science,n/a,n/a,,,10.1111/cts.12805,19463,#99762,Zhou 2020,,,99762,22-04-20

Anaesthesia and COVID-19: infection control,"Odor, Peter M.; Neun, Maximilian; Bampoe, Sohail; Clark, Sam; Heaton, Daniel; Hoogenboom, Emilie M.; Patel, Anil; Brown, Michael; Kamming, Damon","The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.",2020,,Br J Anaesth,,,,32307115,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,20443,#99936,Odor 2020,,,99936,22-04-20

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. Participants 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. Main outcome measures Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. Results 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. Conclusion The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.",2020,,BMJ,369,,m1443-m1443,,10.1136/bmj.m1443,19655,#99975,Zheng 2020,,,99975,22-04-20
